## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
Fully Functional E-commerce Restaurant is a responsive online restaurant website. The technologies used in this project are java, jsp, HTML, CSS, OOPs and mysql. There are a few important modules in the project like home page, image gallery, product listing page, about page, cart page, admin page etc. The data is accessed using mysql call and then rendered into the webpage using dynamic html template created using string literals. For cart-page we are using localstorage to temporarily storing data before clicking on the checkout button. I took almost 40 - 50 hrs to complete this project. SkillLync helped me by providing the wire-frames for all relevant feature pages.
